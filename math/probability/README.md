# Bayesian Probability

This project introduces Bayesian probability concepts using Python and NumPy.

## Topics Covered

- Likelihood for binomial distributions
- Bayesian modeling of real-world experiments
- Validation and error handling for statistical inputs

## Learning Objectives

- Understand likelihood as a measure of how well a probability model explains observed data
- Implement statistical formulas using NumPy
- Apply binomial distributions in real-world scenarios (e.g., medical trials)

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pycodestyle

## Files

- `0-likelihood.py`: Computes likelihood values for hypothetical probabilities
